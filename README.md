# COSC-1336
A collection of simple programs I've written to fulfill lab requirements for *COSC 1336: Fundamentals of Programming*, a beginner-level programming course that introduces Python. Programs are listed below in chronological order of first commit:

#### Conversion Rate Program
Corresponds to Lab 2, 3, and 4 assignments. Calculates and displays simple conversions from Imperial to metric measurements based on user input.
See [program read-me](https://github.com/emnharris/COSC-1336/blob/master/conversion_rate_program/READ_ME.md) for more details.

#### Payroll Program
Corresponds to Lab 3 assignment. Calculates and displays payroll information, including longevity, bonuses, commissions, and deductions, based on user input.
See [program read-me](https://github.com/emnharris/COSC-1336/blob/master/payroll_program/READ_ME.md) for more details.

#### Grade Tracker Program
Corresponds to Lab 4 assignment. Tracks student grades, assigns letter grades, and calculates averages, based on user input.
