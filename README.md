A collection of simple programs I've written to fulfill lab requirements for COSC 1336: Fundamentals of Programming, a beginner-level programming course that introduces Python.

#### Conversion Rate Program
Corresponds to Lab 2 and 3 assignments. Makes simple conversions from Imperial to metric measurements based on user input.

#### Payroll Program
Corresponds to Lab 3 assignment. Displays payroll information, including bonuses, commissions, and deductions, based on user input.
