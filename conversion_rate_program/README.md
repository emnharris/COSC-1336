# Conversion Rate Program

## Project Scope
This program was written to fulfill Lab 2 and 3 assignments for the course *COSC 1336: Fundamentals of Programming*. Lab 2 corresponds to Learning Module 2, which introduced variables, math operations, data output and formatting. Lab 3 corresponds to Learning Module 3, which builds on LM 2 by introducing `if-elif-else` statements and logical operators. Lab 4 corresponds to Learning Module 4, which introduces `while` and `for` loops.

### Limitations
Because Learning Modules 2, 3, and 4 introduce the most basic Python skills, these programs were intentionally designed to use very simple statements and have limited functionality. For example, students were initially instructed to force the program to fail rather than prompt a user for new data should the input data not be validated (this instruction was modified in Lab 4 with the introduction of repetitive structures). The conversions were limited to 5 different calculations, and the user was to have no choice but to run all 5 calculations every time, rather than selecting the desired conversion. Additionally, the program had to use imprecise conversion rates and specific thresholds for data validation as provided by the instructor.

### Future Plans
As my Python skills progress, I may revisit this program and continue to expand its functionality past the requirements of the lab assignments. Higher-level goals for this program include building some kind of GUI, and adding the option to convert USD to GBP using the latest conversion rates scraped from the internet.

## Repo File Descriptions
- Lab 2 entailed creating a simple conversion rate program ([Lab_2_instructions.pdf](https://github.com/emnharris/COSC-1336/blob/master/conversion_rate_program/Lab_2_instructions.pdf)). 
- Lab 3 built upon the same program by adding simple data validation ([Lab_3_instructions.pdf](https://github.com/emnharris/COSC-1336/blob/master/conversion_rate_program/Lab_3_instructions.pdf)).
- Lab 4 built further on the same program by adjusting the data validation to loop before terminating the program ([Lab_4_instructions.pdf](https://github.com/emnharris/COSC-1336/blob/master/conversion_rate_program/Lab_4_instructions.pdf)).
- The conversion program itself has been committed as one file ([conversion_rate_program.py](https://github.com/emnharris/COSC-1336/blob/master/conversion_rate_program/conversion_rate_program.py)).
