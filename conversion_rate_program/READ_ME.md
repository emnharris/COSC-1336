# Conversion Rate Program

## Project Scope
This program was written to fulfill Lab 2 and 3 assignments for the course COSC 1336: Fundamentals of Programming. Lab 2 corresponds to Learning Module 2, which introduced variables, math operations, data output and formatting. Lab 3 corresponds to Learning Module 3, which builds on LM 2 by introducing if-elif-else statements and logical operators. 

## Limitations
Because Learning Modules 2 and 3 introduce the most basic Python skills, these programs were intentionally designed to use very simple statements and have limited functionality. Additionally, the program also had to use imprecise conversion rates provided by the instructor. 

## Future Plans
As my Python skills progress, I may revisit this program and continue to expand its functionality past the requirements of the lab assignments. Higher-level goals for this program include building some kind of GUI, and adding the option to convert USD to GBP using the latest conversion rates scraped from the internet.

## Repo File Descriptions
- Lab 2 entailed creating a simple conversion rate program (**Lab_2_instructions.pdf**). 
- Lab 3 built upon the same program (**Lab_3_instructions.pdf**) by adding simple data validation.
- The conversion program itself has been committed as one file (**conversion_rate_program.py**), with changes committed to the same file.
