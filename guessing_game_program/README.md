# Guessing Game Program

## Project Scope
This program was written to fulfill a Lab 5.2 assignments for the course *COSC 1336: Fundamentals of Programming*. Lab 5.2 corresponds to the second half of [Learning Module 5](https://github.com/emnharris/COSC-1336/wiki/5.-Functions), which introduces value-returning functions, library functions including the `random` module, and creating modules.

This program is a guessing game which will pick a number between 1 and 1000 at random, then ask the user to guess the number. The user receives feedback on how close their answers are, and when the user wins the game they are told how many attempts it took them and asked if they want to play again.

### Future Plans
As my Python skills progress, I may revisit this program and continue to expand its functionality past the requirements of the lab assignments. Higher-level goals for this program include building some kind of GUI.

## Set Up
Because *COSC 1336: Fundamentals of Programming* is an introductory course to programming, the program was written using Python only, and is meant to be run from the terminal without any further set up required.

If you are unfamiliar with running programs from the terminal, read [these directions](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Creating_Python_Programs) for Windows, Mac, and Linux. If you have Python IDLE installed, you can open the program file and run the module. If you have an enhanced text editor such as Visual Studio Code, you can run from a terminal within these editors.

## Repo File Descriptions
- Lab 5.2 asked students to create a simple guessing game ([Lab_5.2_instructions.pdf](https://github.com/emnharris/COSC-1336/blob/master/guessing_game_program/Lab_5.2_instructions.pdf)).
- The conversion program itself has been committed as one file ([guessing_game_program.py](https://github.com/emnharris/COSC-1336/blob/master/guessing_game_program/guessing_game_program.py)).
