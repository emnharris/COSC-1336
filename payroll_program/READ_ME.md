# Payroll Program

## Project Scope
This program was written to fulfill a Lab 3 assignment for the course *COSC 1336: Fundamentals of Programming*. Lab 3 corresponds to Learning Module 3, which introduced Boolean values, if-elif-else statements, and logical operators.

### Limitations
Because the Python skills introduced in Learning Module 3 are very basic, this program was intentionally designed to use very simple statements and have limited functionality. For example, the fact that the program must ask the user to input their own data is undesirable, as that would open up the payroll system to falsifications in pursuit of higher pay. Another undesirable attribute is the clunkiness of the longevity data input fields, which must ask for month and year to be input separately, rather than parsing month and year from an input of MM/YYYY.

### Future Plans
As my Python skills progress, I may revisit this program and continue to expand its functionality past the requirements of the lab assignments. Higher-level goals for this program include building some kind of GUI, and adding database integration in order to avoid employee self-reporting of data.

## Repo File Descriptions
- Lab 3 entailed creating a payroll program that would calculate bonuses, commission, deductions ([Lab_3_instructions.pdf](https://github.com/emnharris/COSC-1336/blob/master/payroll_program/Lab_3_instructions.pdf)).
- The payroll program itseld has been committed as one file ([payroll_program.py](https://github.com/emnharris/COSC-1336/blob/master/payroll_program/payroll_program.py)), with changes committed to the same file.
